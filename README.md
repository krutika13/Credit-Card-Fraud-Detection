# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project involves detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a Linear Regression model. The goal is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on various features in the dataset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project is [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=credit+card+fraud). The dataset includes various features related to credit card transactions, including:

- `Amount`: Transaction amount
- `Time`: Time of transaction
- `Class`: Target variable indicating fraud (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud)

## Model

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is used to predict the likelihood of fraud based on transaction features. Here’s a brief outline of the model:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Encoding categorical variables if any

2. **Model Training:**
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training the Linear Regression model on the training data

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, etc.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the main script to train the model and make predictions:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Check Results:**
   Results and model evaluation metrics will be saved in `results/` directory.

## Results

- **Model Performance:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): `0.XX`
  - R-squared Score: `0.XX`

- **Sample Predictions:**
  The model outputs predictions for whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
